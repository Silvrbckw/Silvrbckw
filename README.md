💻 Hobbyist Coding Setup: Linux Installation

For collaborators and hobbyists looking to join the development effort, a Linux environment is highly recommended for stability and tooling. Here is a brief guide for installing Ubuntu Desktop:

1. Create a Bootable USB Drive

Download the latest Ubuntu Desktop ISO and use a tool like Rufus or Balena Etcher to create a bootable installation media.

2. Basic Installation Steps (Command Line Snippet)

This sequence assumes you have booted into the live environment and are ready to install essential development tools via the terminal after a successful OS installation.

# Update the package list
sudo apt update

# Install essential development tools (build-essential includes GCC, G++, and make)
sudo apt install build-essential git curl zsh vim -y

# Set up Git identity for collaboration
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Install Node.js (required for Web3/dApp development)
curl -fsSL [https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x](https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x) | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

echo "Your Linux environment is ready for development!"
